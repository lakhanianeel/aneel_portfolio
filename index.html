                I have utilized modern HTML5 features and CSS3 styles to build this interface. This project highlights my understanding of semantic HTML markup, effective use of CSS selectors and properties, and implementation of responsive design principles. By combining HTML and CSS, I have created this website with intuitive navigation and an optimized layout.
