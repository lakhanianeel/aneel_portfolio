            <h2>SQL Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work with SQL Server Management Studio through my job as an Operations Analyst. I also have experience working with MySQL on projects to analyze datasets. These two projects demonstrate my proficiency in MySQL. Through these projects, I exhibit my capability to work with large datasets and derive meaningful information and showcase my ability to leverage the power of SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.

            <h2>Python Projects</h2>
            <p>
                In my Python projects, I hope to exhibit my data analitics skills, programming knowledge and problem-solving abilities. These two projects showcase how I can leverage Pandas and libraries for data analysis and visualization and also demonstrate my knowledge in the programming language's syntax, data structures, and algorithm. I also hope to demonstrate my ability to write clean and efficient code.
