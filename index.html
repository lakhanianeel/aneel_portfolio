            <h2>SQL Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work with SQL Server Management Studio through my job as an Operations Analyst. I also have experience working with MySQL on projects to analyze datasets. These two projects demonstrate my proficiency in MySQL. Through these projects, I exhibit my capability to work with large datasets and derive meaningful information and showcase my ability to leverage the power of SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.

            <h2>Python Projects</h2>
            <p>
                In my Python projects, I hope to exhibit my data analitics skills, programming knowledge and problem-solving abilities. These projects showcase how I can leverage pandas and libraries for data analysis and visualization and also demonstrate my knowledge in the programming language's syntax, data structures, and algorithm. I also hope to demonstrate my ability to write clean and efficient code.

            <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>  
            <p>
                I have utilized modern HTML5 features and CSS3 styles to build this interface. Completing this project highlights my understanding of semantic HTML markup, effective use of CSS selectors and properties, and implementation of responsive design principles. By combining HTML and CSS, I have created this website with intuitive navigation and an optimized layout.
