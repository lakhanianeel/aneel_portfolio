            <h2>Project 1 - Washington State Electric Vehicle Analysis </h2>  
            <p>
                In this SQL project, I leveraged the Washington State Department of Licensing's dataset on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to analyze and derive valuable insights. Using MySQL Workbench, I performed AD-HOC analysis to showcase key marketshare information within the dataset.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The dataset used for this project can be found at <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data" target="_blank">catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data</a>. There are over 150,000 total vehicles in this dataset. Some of the interesting columns include: Model Year, Make, Model and Electric Vehicle Type.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The screenshot below shows the query I used to effectively calculate the market share of the two electric vehicle types in the dataset.
                <br>In Washington State, the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), which are the fully electric vehicles, have a much bigger share of the market at 77.89%.
            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                Next I wanted to look at the marketshare for the Make of each vehicle, to see how much of it was taken by Tesla alone. When executing the below query, the output reveals that Tesla does take up a large 59.91% of the total electric vehicle market in Washington State shown below.

            <p>
                The next query I designed, shown below, extracts information from just the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) type. It shows the amount of vehichles each model has from that vehicle type. It also shows the vehicle's battery range.

            <p>
                The next query presents data from just the Plug-in Hyprib Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to see which are most popular models from that type. 
            </p>

            <br><br><br>

            <p>
                Finally, I designed to a query to look at the model year. It  calculated the total number, and percentage of vehicles for the last ten years.

            <h2>Project 2 - Oklahoma Purchase Card Program Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I conducted another analysis utalizing mysql.
                <br>The dataset used in this project can be found at <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/purchase-card-pcard-fiscal-year-2022-31015" target="_blank">catalog.data.gov/dataset/purchase-card-pcard-fiscal-year-2022-31015</a>. It contains over 25,000 transactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This  dataset contains information on purchases made through the purchase card programs administered by the state of Oklahoma and higher education institutions for the 2022 fiscal year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The screenshot below shows most of the important columns. 
            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                The below query utilizes the GROUP BY clause and the SUM(AMOUNT) function to identify the top 20 agencies with the highest total purchase amounts.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, it calculates the percentage of each agency's expenditure in relation to the overall spending. This calculation is performed by dividing an agency's sum of purchase amounts by the total purchase amount of all agencies, which is obtained through a subquery using the SELECT SUM(AMOUNT) function and the FROM statement.
            </p>
            <img src="images/agencies_with_highest_amounts.png" alt="agencies_with_highest_amounts" width="1400">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                With this query shown below, I looked at transaction counts of MCC (Merchandise Category Code) descriptions, to find the most common merchandise categories and their corresponding transaction volumes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This query groups the data by MCC_DESCRIPTION and calculates the count of transactions within each category using the COUNT(*) function. By leveraging the GROUP BY clause, I ensured that the results were aggregated by MCC_DESCRIPTION.
            </p>
            <img src="images/merch_desc_count.png" alt="merch_desc_count" width="1400">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                In this next and final query, I look more in detail into expenditure trends and patterns.
            </p>
            
            <img src="images/agency_expenditure.png" alt="agency_expenditure" width="1400">
            <p>
                I use the COUNT(*) and SUM(AMOUNT) functions again as well as the MAX(AMOUNT) function which finds the maximum amount spent in a single transaction by each agency. This shows the highest individual expenditure for each agency. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The MIN(AMOUNT) function retrieves the minimum amount spent in a single transaction by each agency. This reveals lowest individual expenditure for each agency. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The AVG(AMOUNT) function calculates the average amount spent per transaction by each agency. This helps gives an understanding of the typical expenditure level for each agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating the code for this query demonstrates my ability to extract meaningful insights from financial datasets, analyze transaction data, and provide potentially actionable information for informed decision-making in financial analysis and resource allocation.
