        <p>
            The Python Guessing Game is an interactive program that showcases my proficiency in Python programming. It utilizes key concepts such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and string formatting. The game also demonstrates my ability to implement logical decision-making, and provide a responsive user interface.
        </p>  
        <p>
            The game offers the player a choice to either win $10 or play the guessing game for a chance to win a larger prize. Throughout the game, the player has 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000. The program dynamically adjusts the prize money based on the player's progress and provides feedback on each guess, indicating if the guess is too high or too low.
