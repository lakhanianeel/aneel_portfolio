        <h2>Guessing game</h2>
        <p>
            This Python Guessing Game is an interactive program that showcases my proficiency in Python programming. It utilizes key concepts such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, loops, string formatting and functions. The game also demonstrates my ability to implement logical decision-making, and provide a responsive user interface.

            Below are screenshots of the code and also of the program being played out.

            The program offers the user a choice to either win $10 or play the guessing game for a chance to win a larger prize. Throughout the game, the user has 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 1000.

            The program dynamically adjusts the prize money based on the user's progress and provides feedback on each guess, indicating if the guess is too high or too low.

            It's very hard to win a big prize, it would be smarter to take the $10, unless you are feeling lucky!
